	abstract = {Dysregulated cell-cell communication is a hallmark of many disease phenotypes. Due to recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics and computational approaches, it is now possible to study intercellular communication on a genome- and tissue-wide scale. However, most current cell-cell communication inference tools have limitations when analyzing data from multiple samples and conditions. Their main limitation is that they do not address inter-sample heterogeneity adequately, which could lead to false inference. This issue is crucial for analyzing human cohort scRNA-seq datasets, complicating the comparison between healthy and diseased subjects.},
