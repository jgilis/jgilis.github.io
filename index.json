Benchmarking is important for all methods, but with a focus here on computational methods, benchmarking is critical to dissect important steps of analysis pipelines, formally assess performance across common situations as well as edge cases, and ultimately guide users on what tools to use. Benchmarking can also be important for community building and advancing methods in a principled way. We conducted a meta-analysis of recent single-cell benchmarks to summarize the scope, extensibility, neutrality, as well as technical features and whether best practices in open data and reproducible research were followed. The results highlight that while benchmarks often make code available and are in principle reproducible, they remain difficult to extend, for example, as new methods and new ways to assess methods emerge. In addition, embracing containerization and workflow systems would enhance reusability of intermediate benchmarking results, thus also driving wider adoption.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Meta-analysis of (single-cell method) benchmarks reveals the need for extensibility and interoperability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeroen Gilis","Kristoffer Vitting-Seerup","Koen Van den Berge","Lieven Clement"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1661126400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661126400,"objectID":"0f0a5548b946952e1975c1b3a4af8564","permalink":"https://jgilis.github.io/publication/saturn/","publishdate":"2022-08-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/saturn/","section":"publication","summary":"Alternative splicing produces multiple functional transcripts from a single gene. Dysregulation of splicing is known to be associated with disease and as a hallmark of cancer. Existing tools for differential transcript usage (DTU) analysis either lack in performance, cannot account for complex experimental designs or do not scale to massive single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. We introduce satuRn, a fast and flexible quasi-binomial generalized linear modelling framework that is on par with the best performing DTU methods from the bulk RNA-seq realm, while providing good false discovery rate control, addressing complex experimental designs, and scaling to scRNA-seq applications.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"satuRn; Scalable analysis of differential transcript usage for bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeroen Gilis, Steff Taelman, Lucas Davey, Lennart Martens and Lieven Clement"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1597795200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597795200,"objectID":"2b014bc40c60b7226eabe46d038fffd8","permalink":"https://jgilis.github.io/publication/hpa_commentary/","publishdate":"2020-08-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hpa_commentary/","section":"publication","summary":"Uhlen et al. (Reports, 18 august 2017) published an open-access resource with cancer-specific marker genes that are prognostic for patient survival in seventeen different types of cancer. However, their data analysis workflow is prone to the accumulation of false positives. A more reliable workflow with flexible Cox proportional hazards models employed on the same data highlights three distinct problems with such large-scale, publicly available omics datasets from observational studies today; (i) re-analysis results can not necessarily be taken forward by others, highlighting a need to cross-check important analyses with high impact outcomes; (ii) current methods are not necessarily optimal for the re-analysis of such data, indicating an urgent need to develop more suitable methods; and (iii) the limited availability of potential confounders in public metadata renders it very difficult (if not impossible) to adequately prioritize clinically relevant genes, which should prompt an in-depth discussion on how such information could be made more readily available while respecting privacy and ethics concerns.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Pitfalls in re-analysis of observational omics studies; a post-mortem of the human pathology atlas","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
