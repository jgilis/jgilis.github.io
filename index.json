Large-scale studies with multiple biological samples hold promise for discovering differentially expressed biomarkers with a higher level of confidence through a better characterization of the target population. However, the hierarchical nature of these experiments introduces a significant challenge for downstream statistical analysis. Indeed, despite the availability of numerous differential expression methods, only a select few can accurately address the within-patient correlation of single-cell expression profiles. Furthermore, due to the high computational costs associated with some of these methods, their practical use is limited. In this manuscript, we undertake a comprehensive assessment of different strategies to address the hierarchical correlation structure in multi-sample scRNA-seq data. We employ synthetic data generated from a simulator that retains the original correlation structure of multi-patient data while making minimal assumptions, providing a robust platform for benchmarking method performance. Our analyses indicate that neglecting within-patient correlation jeopardizes type I error control. We show that, in line with some previous reports and in contrast with others, Poisson Generalized Estimation Equations provide a useful and flexible framework for addressing these issues. We also show that pseudobulk approaches outperform single-cell level methods across the board. In this work, we resolve the conflicting results regarding the utility of GEEs and their performance relative to pseudobulk approaches. As such, we provide valuable guidelines for researchers navigating the complex landscape of gene expression modeling, and offer insights on choosing the most appropriate methods based on the specific structure and design of their datasets.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Strategies for addressing pseudoreplication in multi-patient scRNA-seq data","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1697101200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1697101200,"objectID":"18f5a6926da02c416c8b353d4e7f53e5","permalink":"https://jgilis.github.io/talk/lisco-multiomics-workshop/","publishdate":"2023-10-13T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/lisco-multiomics-workshop/","section":"event","summary":"A 2-day workshop by the KU Leuven Institute for Single Cell Omics that aims to provide a comprehensive theoretical overview on single-cell omics technologies, experimental design and analysis.

Single-cell transcriptomics, however, also has the promise to prioritise genes for which the expression differ in other aspects of the distribution. Here we develop a workflow for assessing differential detection (DD), which tests for differences in the average fraction of samples or cells in which a gene is detected. After benchmarking eight different DD data analysis strategies, we provide a unified workflow for jointly assessing DE and DD. Using simulations and two case studies, we show that DE and DD analysis provide complementary information, both in terms of the individual genes they report and in the functional interpretation of those genes.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Differential detection workflows for multi-sample single-cell RNA-seq data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandre Segers","Jeroen Gilis","Mattias Van Heetvelde","Elfride De Baere","Lieven Clement"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1688169600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688169600,"objectID":"55d78a9b7c69cad5d9e29d75477750a5","permalink":"https://jgilis.github.io/publication/jugglingoffsets/","publishdate":"2022-07-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jugglingoffsets/","section":"publication","summary":"RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is increasingly used to diagnose patients with rare diseases by prioritising genes with aberrant expression and/or splicing. State-of-the-art methods for detecting aberrant expression and splicing, however, are extremely slow. The latter, also discard much information because they only use junction reads to infer aberrant splicing. In this contribution, we show that replacing the offset for library size unlocks conventional bulk RNA-seq workflows for fast and scalable differential usage, aberrant splicing and expression analyses. Our method, saseR, is several orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art methods and dramatically outperforms these in terms of sensitivity and specificity for aberrant splicing, while being on par with these inferring differential usage and aberrant expression. Finally, our framework is also very flexible and can be used for all applications that involve the analysis of proportions of short- or long RNA-seq read counts.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Juggling offsets unlocks RNA-seq tools for fast scalable differential usage, aberrant splicing and expression analyses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robin Browaeys","Jeroen Gilis","Chananchida Sang-Aram","Pieter De Bleser","Levi Hoste","Simon J.

Due to recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics and computational approaches, it is now possible to study intercellular communication on a genome- and tissue-wide scale. However, most current cell-cell communication inference tools have limitations when analyzing data from multiple samples and conditions. Their main limitation is that they do not address inter-sample heterogeneity adequately, which could lead to false inference. This issue is crucial for analyzing human cohort scRNA-seq datasets, complicating the comparison between healthy and diseased subjects. Therefore, we developed MultiNicheNet (https://github.com/saeyslab/multinichenetr), a novel framework to better analyze cell-cell communication from multi-sample multi-condition single-cell transcriptomics data. The main goals of MultiNicheNet are inferring the differentially expressed and active ligand-receptor pairs between conditions of interest and predicting the putative downstream target genes of these pairs. To achieve this goal, MultiNicheNet applies the principles of state-of-the-art differential expression algorithms for multi-sample scRNA-seq data. As a result, users can analyze differential cell-cell communication while adequately addressing inter-sample heterogeneity, handling complex multifactorial experimental designs, and correcting for batch effects and covariates. Moreover, MultiNicheNet uses NicheNet-v2, our new and substantially improved version of NicheNet's ligand-receptor network and ligand-target prior knowledge model. We applied MultiNicheNet to patient cohort data of several diseases (breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and lung fibrosis). For these diseases, MultiNicheNet uncovered known and novel aberrant cell-cell signaling processes. We also demonstrated MultiNicheNet's potential to perform non-trivial analysis tasks, such as studying between- and within-group differences in cell-cell communication dynamics in response to therapy. As a final example, we used MulitNicheNet to elucidate dysregulated intercellular signaling in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis while correcting batch effects in integrated atlas data. Given the anticipated increase in multi-sample scRNA-seq datasets due to technological advancements and extensive atlas-building integration efforts, we expect that MultiNicheNet will be a valuable tool to uncover differences in cell-cell communication between healthy and diseased states.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"MultiNicheNet; a flexible framework for differential cell-cell communication analysis from multi-sample multi-condition single-cell transcriptomics data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Sonrel","Almut Luetge","Charlotte Soneson","Izaskun Mallona Gonzalez","Pierre-Luc Germain","Sergey Knyazev","Jeroen Gilis","Reto Gerber","Ruth Seurinck","Dominique Paul","Emanuel Sonder","Helena L Crowell","Imran Fanaswala","Ahmad Al Ajami","Elyas Heidari","Stephan Schmeing","Stefan Milosavljevic","Yvan Saeys","Serghei Mangul","Mark D Robinson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1679961600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679961600,"objectID":"fe1c73f22320169e4b2c1ef78bd6d21d","permalink":"https://jgilis.github.io/publication/omnibenchmark/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/omnibenchmark/","section":"publication","summary":"Computational methods represent the lifeblood of modern molecular biology. Benchmarking is important for all methods, but with a focus here on computational methods, benchmarking is critical to dissect important steps of analysis pipelines, formally assess performance across common situations as well as edge cases, and ultimately guide users on what tools to use. Benchmarking can also be important for community building and advancing methods in a principled way. We conducted a meta-analysis of recent single-cell benchmarks to summarize the scope, extensibility, and neutrality, as well as technical features and whether best practices in open data and reproducible research were followed. The results highlight that while benchmarks often make code available and are in principle reproducible, they remain difficult to extend, for example, as new methods and new ways to assess methods emerge. In addition, embracing containerization and workflow systems would enhance reusability of intermediate benchmarking results, thus also driving wider adoption.","tags":null,"title":"Meta-analysis of (single-cell method) benchmarks reveals the need for extensibility and interoperability","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1675328400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675328400,"objectID":"2c1d4f25cbcdb4846e7fbd3078ec19b0","permalink":"https://jgilis.github.io/talk/statistical-methods-for-post-genomic-data-conference/","publishdate":"2023-05-19T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/statistical-methods-for-post-genomic-data-conference/","section":"event","summary":"Annual meeting dedicated to statistical methods for genomic data analysis.
